## Goroutines

1. What are Goroutines?

    - Goroutines are functions or methods that run concurrently with other functions or methods.
    - Goroutines can be thought of as lightweight threads. The cost of creating a Goroutine is tiny when compared to a thread.

    Advantages of Goroutines over threads
    **

    - Goroutines are extremely cheap when compared to threads. They are only a few kb in stack size and the stack can grow and shrink according to the needs of the application whereas in the case of threads the stack size has to be specified and is fixed.
    - The Goroutines are multiplexed to a fewer number of OS threads. There might be only one thread in a program with thousands of Goroutines. If any Goroutine in that thread blocks say waiting for user input, then another OS thread is created and the remaining Goroutines are moved to the new OS thread. All these are taken care of by the runtime and we as programmers are abstracted from these intricate details and are given a clean API to work with concurrency.
    - Goroutines communicate using channels. Channels by design prevent race conditions from happening when accessing shared memory using Goroutines. Channels can be thought of as a pipe using which Goroutines communicate. We will discuss channels in detail in the next tutorial.
